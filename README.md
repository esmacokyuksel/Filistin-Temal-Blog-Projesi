Project Details:
In the user section of my project, anyone logging into the site can see all the blogs available, comment on existing blogs, and list blogs by author or category.
In the writer section, authors can write new blogs, make edits to their own blogs, view comments on their blogs, and send messages to other writers or the admin.
In the admin section, authorization is provided for categories, blogs, contacts, and all other menus. Comments can be deleted by the admin.
